# calculator

note: No need to import strftime module
Use the geometry of the window as i have done to get a perfect Layout

the Buttons are arranged with cordinates so i have used lambda funtion to give command to our buttons
the sign "+/-" works in some different way 
No need to define the time function
note: Root button does not work
